# National Basketball Association Application

## 1. Overview

The National Basketball Application is a mobile app designed to enhance user engagement with basketball league data through an intuitive and dynamic interface. Built using Dart and Flutter, the app leverages a RESTful API to import real-time data, including team standings, player stats, and team locations.

## 2. Feature Overview

The app includes three primary pages:

1. **Map Page**: Visualizes all teams' locations on a map. Users can select a favorite team, triggering a special animation for that team, and click on any team to view detailed information about that team's players and stats. The Map Page acts as a home page for the application and contains a drawer allowing the user to navigate to the Standings Page.

2. **Standings Page**: Displays up-to-date standings across the league, showing each teamâ€™s record, win percentage, and ranking. Further, this screen contains a drawer allowing the user to view the league standings from any season following 2018.

3. **Team Information Page**: Displays team-specific details, including conference, divsion, and the team's active roster. The roster information displays players information including their number, name, position, height, weight, college, and years in the league.
